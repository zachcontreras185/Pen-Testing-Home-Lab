# Pen Testing Home Lab

## Objective
The Pen Testing Home Lab project aimed to establish a controlled environment for simulating and detecting cyber attack; while also providing knowledge on virtualization and the managment of virtual machines. The primary purpose was to gain an understanding of the different aspects of virtualization, such as virtual disks, virtual networks, and the machines themselves. The primary focus was to ingest and analyze logs within a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system, while also learning different Red Team tactics and how to better defend against them.

### Skills Learned
- Advanced understanding of virtualization as a whole.
- Proficiency in installing various different types of operating systems, such as Ubuntu and Security Onion.
- Ability to manage various aspects of virtual machines, such as virtual disks and networks.
- Enhanced knowledge of network protocols and security vulnerabilities.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.

### Tools Used
- Oracle VirtualBox for the management and creation of the virtual machines.
- Windows Server 2025 as the server manager OS
- Ubuntu Linux as a user machine and security machine
- Kali Linux as an attacker machine.
